## After level 5
### Level 1
>Why did you sign up for infiltration duty again? The pamphlets from Bunny HQ promised exotic and interesting missions, yet here you are drudging in the lowest level of Commander Lambda's organization. Hopefully you get that promotion soon...

* [`solar_doomsday`](tasks/solar_doomsday) time given: 48 hours

> You survived a week in Commander Lambda's organization, and you even managed to get yourself promoted. Hooray! Henchmen still don't have the kind of security access you'll need to take down Commander Lambda, though, so you'd better keep working. Chop chop!

### Level 2
>The latest gossip in the henchman breakroom is that "LAMBCHOP" stands for "Lambda's Anti-Matter Biofuel Collision Hadron Oxidating Potentiator". You're pretty sure it runs on diesel, not biofuel, but you can at least give the commander credit for trying.

* [`lovely_lucky_lambs`](tasks/lovely_lucky_lambs) time given: 72 hours

>At least all this time spent running errands all over Commander Lambda's space station have given you a really good 
understanding of the station's layout. You'll need that when you're finally ready to destroy the LAMBCHOP and rescue the bunny prisoners.

* [`elevator_maintenance`](tasks/elevator_maintenance) time given: 72 hours
